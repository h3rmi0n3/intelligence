   "description": "Our first non-review paper of the semester will be on using Deep RNNs to perform speech recognition tasks. This approach seeks to combine the advantages of deep neural networks wtih the \"flexible use of long-range context that empowers RNNs\". The abstract is rather lengthy, so I'll refrain from copying it here. Our weekly  meeting on this paper will go over questions from the paper, strategies for reading  more complex research papers, and how to identify strengths and weaknesses of journal  articles.",
